# DURKON

This is the raw code for Durkon, a modelling library for inherently-interpretable GLM-style models.

If you're already using this library in its raw form, you should keep using it; if you want an introduction to Durkon, you should look [here](https://github.com/H-B-P/Durkon-demo-II); if you want a zero-code HTML implementation of basic Durkon functionality, you should look [here](https://h-b-p.github.io/Durkon-HTML/)
